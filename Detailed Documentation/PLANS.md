# Future Plans

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I have started exploring **The Rust Programming Language**, so this project has been archived (kind of).
> After, my mental model is coherent with Rust, I aim to re-write this whole project in Rust.

With the passage of time, I will add the following features to **mmqlc**. The details are as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> It is not clear, whether these features will come to C++ version or Rust version.

- **Better Project Directory Structure [WIP].**
- **Better Comments**
- **Intelligent Variables Evaluation.**
- **Basic Coordinate Geometry.**
- **Numerical Linear Algebra.**
-
    - **Supported Dimensions for Vectors: 2x2 and 3x3**
-
    - **Supported Dimensions for Matrices: 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x5, 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, 2x4, 2x5, 3x1, 3x2, 3x3, 3x4, 3x5,
      4x1, 4x2, 4x3, 4x4, 4x5, 5x1, 5x2, 5x3, 5x4, 5x5.**
- **Variables Support for Numerical Linear Algebra.**
- **GNUPlot based graphing(To Be Decided)**
